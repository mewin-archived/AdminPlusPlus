# AdminPlusPlus
A small [ManiaControl](https://maniacontrol.com/) plugin for server administration. Not nearly finished, only contains a single feature yet.

This project will probably never be finished, but I uploaded it as some people might find it useful.

## Features
Keeps track of any players used ingame nick names. Type `/nicks <login>` to view them.

## Install
Just drop the *mewin* directory into your ManiaControl plugins folder.

## License
Published under the MIT license. See LICENSE for the full text.
